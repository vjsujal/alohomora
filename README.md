Hackathon Name : 9Hacks (NextTechLab-AP)

Problem Statement:
  The hostel students are facing many issues now-a-days, the problems are like..
  1) The graduating hostlers will left the their stack of things while vacating the room, where it is considered as trash though it is useful for others!.
  2) The college students are facing a non-availability transport in some situations!.
  3) The students are not socially well-connected in most of the scenarios like outing/travelling.
  4) When the student wish to eat peacefull food, they facing a issue in ordering of food like either app defect or food quality related thing!.

Solution:
  So we came up with the solution for all above scenarious in the problem statement.

  The solution for 1st scenario is we can create an application like cart for college/universities, so that instead of wasting a things/ they can sell the useful things and they can share with the new-comers!. Both side will be benifited!.

  The solution for 2nd scenario is studends can share their travelling with other travellers, it's a cheap way and stress free way to move place to place.

  The solution for 3rd scenario is When the student going for an outing, he/she can post in the app, so that the people will connect in that particular moment who are interest to travel with him/her, which it improves the connections of people.

  The solution for 4th scenario is Students are ordering an food, using 3rd-party applications, so we came up with an app, where we will have an option to order food, where we will have more options to order.

  It acts as a all-in-one app for college students which it meets all their requirements/needs.
